###Summary###

# This section includes Python and R script files that process the quantitative expression matrix data from gPeptide software.
# An expression matrix table for demostrating the procedure is provided as "test_expression_matrix.csv"


###Depedencies###

# Python 3.9.7+ and R 4.3.0+ are needed to run the script files.
# For Python scripts: matplotlib and seaborn for your specific Python version are needed. Any IDE such as Spyder, Pycharm is recommanded.
# For R scripts: missForest, sva and bladderbatch libraries for your specific R version are needed. RStudio is recommanded.


###Protocol Steps###

1) Set the working directory to the folder named "Data_Processing_from_gPeptide" both in Python and R environment (or Python IDE/RStudio).
2) Run "ID_FIlter.py" script file using Python or Python IDE. A table named "Expression_Matrix.csv" will be generated, containing N-glycopeptides identified within at least 11 organs out of 18.
3) Run "Imputation.R" script file using R or RStudio. A table named "Expression_Matrix_Imputed.csv" will be generated.
4) Run "Batch_Effect_Correction.R" script file using R or RStudio. A table named "Expression_Matrix_BEC.csv" will be generated.
5) Run "Normalization.py" script file using Python or Python IDE. Two tables named "Expression_Matrix_Norm.csv" and "Expression_Matrix_for_Cluster.csv" will be generated.
6) Run "Clustering.py" script file using Python or Python IDE. A table named "Expression_Matrix_Clustered.csv" and a hierarchical clustering figure named "cluster_map.png" will be generated.
